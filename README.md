NGSTrefftz provides a framework to implement Trefftz finite element spaces for [NGSolve](https://www.ngsolve.org), with several Trefftz spaces already implemented. Additionally, Trefftz-DG on tent-pitched meshes for the acoustic wave equation is implemented using meshes provided by [ngstents](https://github.com/jayggg/ngstents). Furthermore, the package includes an implementation of the embedded Trefftz method.

## Try it out!
You can try out some jupyter notebooks:
* Launch the Binder here:   
  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PaulSt/NGSTrefftz/HEAD?filepath=docs%2Fnotebooks%2Findex.ipynb)
* Or run the docker locally (you need to have docker installed):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PaulSt/NGSTrefftz
cd NGSTrefftz && docker build -t ngstrefftz_jupyter .
docker run -p 8888:8888 ngstrefftz_jupyter
```

## Installing the package
You can either:
 * install using pip

```bash
pip install ngstrefftz
```

 * or build from source

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/PaulSt/NGSTrefftz
mkdir ./NGSTrefftz/make && cd ./NGSTrefftz/make
cmake ../src && make install
```

### Dependencies
To build the package the following software needs to be installed
 * [cmake](https://cmake.org/) >= 3.1
 * [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) >= 9 or [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) >= 10
 * [ngsolve](https://www.ngsolve.org) >= 6.2

To access the newest features the nightly version of NGSolve works best and [lapack](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) >= 3.9 is required.

## News
⚠️ Oct, 2022: With v0.2.0 the git history has undergone a major cleanup, please make sure to clone the repo anew.

🚀 Oct, 2022: New and improved implementation of the embedded Trefftz method via `EmbeddedTrefftzFES`!

🚀 Aug, 2022: Three different [pip](https://pypi.org/search/?q=ngstrefftz)-installer available, now using wheels! 

🚀 Mar, 2022: NGSTrefftz now has a [website](https://paulst.github.io/NGSTrefftz/)! 

⚠️ Feb, 2022: If you are using NGSolve nightly releases: [NGSolve@eda758d](https://github.com/NGSolve/ngsolve/commit/eda758d99483888851913d8a5c9aff4d0cbc9cc2) breaks a dependency and [NGSolve@3d52ecd](https://github.com/NGSolve/ngsolve/commit/3d52ecd615f2b7c409219eebaba99288ea19c1bc) produces import issue. Make sure to update ngstrefftz submodules and move to newest ngsolve version, at least [NGSolve@5839a09](https://github.com/NGSolve/ngsolve/commit/5839a09810235a938bd85807d8e638d3a0b6c69d).
